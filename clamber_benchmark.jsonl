"{\"question\": \"Give me a one line summary of the story below: \\n\\nA long long time ago the Queen of Odisha heard that there was a master stone sculptor who made such stunning statues of the gods that people would weep from happiness at the beauty of the statues if they saw them. One summer day, while resting indolently with the King in the main hall of the royal palace, the Queen suddenly had a thought. \\\"How nice it would be, King, if we could build some beautiful statutes of Lord Jagannath so that the people can come worship Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subadhra. What do you think?\\\" \\n\\nThe King thought for a few minutes, and then nodded in agreement. \\\"What do you have in mind, my Queen?\\\" And so, soon the stone sculptor was summoned to appear before the Court for an appointment to build in his way the statutes of the gods. Soon the monsoon season started and the sculptor appeared in front of the court, awaiting his appointment. He was a humble man from the mountainous regions of Odisha. Even at his best-dressed, one couldn't help but notice his rough hands, and the small sprinkling of dust that seemed ever present in his hair. \\n\\nThe King and Queen graciously waited as the sculptor bowed and then asked \\\"Your majesties, what can I do for you?\\\" The Queen leaned forward in her throne and her voice rang out in the court \\\"We have heard, o Master Sculptor, of your skills from people far and wide across the Kingdom. We dream of having you put your skills to use to build beautiful statues that will represent Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra for our people to worship.\\\"\\n\\nThe sculptor was silent. As his silence extended, ministers of the court began to feel restless. \\\"Speak up! How can you be silent when the Queen graces you so!\\\" But still, the sculptor was silent. \\n\\nThe King and Queen sat patiently in their thrones as they waited for the sculptor to respond. Perhaps the enormity of the task was too much. Perhaps, the sculptor was thinking of what he should ask for in return. Or even more, perhaps, the sculptor was awed and honored by the request. \\n\\nAt last, as the shadows from the late afternoon sun began to stretch across the floors of the hall, the sculptor shifted his weight, and opened his mouth to speak. \\\"Your majesties, you grace me with such a request, I cannot help but oblige. It is an honor.\\\" At this, the Queen sat as straight as a rod, listening for the words that would come next. \\\"But, I can do this on one condition only. I will work in a closed hall, where none may enter - regardless of whether they can hear me working or otherwise. None may enter until I open the doors from within and proclaim to all that the statues are completed.\\\"\\n\\nThe ministers gasped - what a strange request from this man. Was he a fool? What if he just slept and ate and didn't do any work? How could the King and Queen trust that he would do the work he was promising to do? The Queen looked on thoughtfully. She glanced at the King, and it seemed to her that he agreed on this condition without reservation. She looked at the sculptor and then nodded her assent. \\\"We decree that you shall build these statues in a hall set aside, into which no one shall enter until your work is complete and you proclaim that to us after opening the doors of the hall from within.\\\"\", \"context\": \"\", \"clarifying_question\": \"\", \"require_clarification\": 0, \"category\": \"MC\", \"subclass\": \"none\", \"predict_ambiguous\": 0, \"predict_is_ambiguous_response\": \"{\\\"Output\\\": \\\"False\\\", \\\"Confidence\\\": 4}\", \"predict_clarifying_question\": \"Clarifying question: How long is the sculptor allowed to work on the statues before he must open the doors and proclaim them as completed?\"}\n"
